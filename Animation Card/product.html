            <p>
              Powerful new capabilities come to Apple Vision Pro just months
              after its U.S. release, including a new way to turn favourite
              photos into spatial photos, new gestures for navigating visionOS,
              and more ways for developers to take advantage of spatial
              computing.</p>
              <p>“Apple Vision Pro delivers revolutionary experiences
              for users and developers, and we’re excited to advance spatial
              computing even further with visionOS 2 just months after its
              initial release,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of
              the Vision Products Group. “From navigating visionOS more
              seamlessly to pushing the boundaries of how users connect with
              memories, and enhancements to key Vision Pro apps, we can’t wait
              for users to experience the range of new capabilities with
              visionOS 2. And with a robust set of tools that enable developers
              to create richer spatial apps, visionOS 2 makes Vision Pro even
              more powerful.”
